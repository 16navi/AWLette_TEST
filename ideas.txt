For Fixing:
1. About
2. Footer

fix stopImmediatePropagation errors:
    * across all pages that have it.

error handling: 
    * 404
    * id is non-existent (classroom, quiz)

nielsen's heuristics

match - getting the wrong answer:
    * instead of nothing, wrong answers should flash red and then quickly fade away.
