favorite word:
    * users can favorite a word
    * have a seperate page displaying the user's favorite words

about refreshing quiz content:
    * instead of refreshing, use async posts to get the necessary data in the background and then just continuously show the questions after getting it right.
    * craete a 'pending' state. users can still reload, but it will just load the same unanswered questions unless they get everything right.

give up button:
    * user can click the button, enabling a give up option. This shows the correct answer for each quiz.
    * but before clicking the button, a guilt message will pop up.
    * this can go like "ARE YOU SURE? It's okay if you take some time to think for the right answer! After all, strain is important for muscle growth---and your brain is the smartest muscle!"

Choices in fill in the blanks:
    * can be the root word instead of the exact answer (or can be randomly chosen to be either)
    * nominalisation of the root word 

Progress tracking for quiz quiz:
    * can also keep track of the ratio of rights over wrong across all the user's attempt at quiz quiz

THINGS I DID THAT WERE APPARENTLY AGAINST THE CONVENTION
1. HTML id's are supposed to look like "lorem-ipsum"---not underscores. ://///
